it will keep score, open the lyrics in Genius.com, and also the song in Youtube.com.

It goes like that:

2. Choose who'll play
3. Run the code, it will choose a song randomly for you, and open the lyrics online
4. Charades - use only gestures, no speaking, so the other players could guess the song.

6. Continue to the next song!
